# Robot-Arm-Control-Panel
This is a Control Panel for a Robot Arm,
this project provides a simple web interface to control a 6-motor robot arm.

Users can adjust each motorâ€™s angle using sliders,
save different arm positions ("poses") to a MySQL database, 
load and delete saved poses, 
send the latest pose to the robot arm for execution.

The interface uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP with MySQL for backend database handling.
